# More Malloc, Free

This project continues practicing **dynamic memory allocation** in C.  
You will learn how to allocate, concatenate, and manage memory safely.

---

## Files and Tasks

### 0. Malloc checked
- **File:** `0-malloc_checked.c`
- Function that allocates memory using `malloc` and exits with status 98 if it fails.

---

### 1. String n-concat
- **File:** `1-string_nconcat.c`
- Function that concatenates two strings into newly allocated memory, taking at most `n` bytes from the second string.

---

### 2. Calloc
- **File:** `2-calloc.c`
- Function that allocates memory for an array using `malloc` and initializes all bytes to 0.

---

### 3. Array range
- **File:** `3-array_range.c`
- Function that creates an array of integers containing all values from `min` to `max`.

---

## Summary
This project helps practice:
- Allocating memory dynamically with `malloc` and `calloc`.
- Checking for allocation failures.
- Working with arrays and strings in dynamic memory.
