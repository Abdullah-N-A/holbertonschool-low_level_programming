# Structures and Typedef

This project introduces **structures** and **typedef** in C.  
You will learn how to define a structure, initialize it, print its content, and manage memory dynamically.

---

## Files and Tasks

### 0. Main file
- **File:** `0-main.c`
- Test file to check the initialization of a `dog` structure.

---

### 1. Initialize a dog
- **File:** `1-init_dog.c`
- Function to initialize a `dog` structure with name, age, and owner.

---

### 2. Print a dog
- **File:** `2-print_dog.c`
- Function that prints the details of a `dog` structure: name, age, and owner.

---

### 3. Main file
- **File:** `3-main.c`
- Test file to check the creation of a new `dog` with dynamic memory allocation.

---

### 4. New dog
- **File:** `4-new_dog.c`
- Function that creates a new `dog` structure in dynamic memory and returns a pointer to it.

---

### 5. Free dog
- **File:** `5-free_dog.c`
- Function that frees all memory allocated for a `dog` structure.

---

## Summary
This project helps practice:
- Defining and using structures in C.
- Using `typedef` to simplify structure names.
- Initializing structures and printing their contents.
- Allocating and freeing memory dynamically.
