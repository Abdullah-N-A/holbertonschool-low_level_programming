# Low-Level Programming Projects

This repository contains multiple C programming projects from the low-level programming track.  
Each directory focuses on a specific topic in C and introduces new concepts.

- Building programs that take arguments.

---

### 10. structures_typedef
Working with structures:
- Defining and using `struct`.
- Using `typedef` for simplicity.
- Building data models with structures.

---

### 11. function_pointers
Introduction to function pointers:
- Passing functions as arguments.
- Iterating with function pointers.
- Building a simple calculator program.


### 12 Variadic Functions in C
Variadic functions are functions that accept a variable number of arguments.
How to Use Variadic Functions

Declare a va_list variable to access the variable arguments.

Initialize the variable argument list with va_start, specifying the last fixed argument.

Retrieve arguments one by one using va_arg, specifying the type.

Clean up using va_end after done.
