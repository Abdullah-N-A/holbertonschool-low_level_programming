# More Functions, Nested Loops

This project continues practicing **functions** and **nested loops** in C.  
You will learn to create functions for different tasks and use nested loops for printing patterns and numbers.

## Files and Tasks

### 0. Check uppercase
- **File:** `0-isupper.c`
- Function that checks if a character is uppercase.

---

### 1. Check digit
- **File:** `1-isdigit.c`
- Function that checks if a character is a digit.

---

### 2. Multiply two integers
- **File:** `2-mul.c`
- Function that multiplies two integers and returns the result.

---

### 3. Print numbers
- **File:** `3-print_numbers.c`
- Function that prints numbers from 0 to 9 using loops.

---

### 4. Print most numbers
- **File:** `4-print_most_numbers.c`
- Function that prints numbers from 0 to 9 excluding 2 and 4.

---

### 5. More numbers
- **File:** `5-more_numbers.c`
- Function that prints numbers from 0 to 14 ten times using loops.

---

### 6. Print line
