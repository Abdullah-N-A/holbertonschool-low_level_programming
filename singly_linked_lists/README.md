Singly Linked List Operations in C

This project covers fundamental operations on singly linked lists in C.
You will learn how to print the list, calculate its length, add nodes at different positions, and properly free the listâ€™s memory.

Files and Tasks
0. PRINT LIST

Traverse and print all elements from the head node to the end of the list.

1. LIST LENGTH

Calculate and return the total number of nodes in the list.

2. ADD NODE

Insert a new node at the beginning of the list.

3. ADD NODE AT THE END

Insert a new node at the end of the list.

4. FREE LIST

Free all allocated memory used by the list nodes to avoid memory leaks.

Summary

This project helps practice:

Traversing linked lists.

Counting nodes in a list.

Inserting nodes at the beginning and end.

Proper memory management by freeing allocated nodes.
