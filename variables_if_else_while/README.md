# Variables, if, else, while

This project introduces the basics of variables, conditional statements, and loops in C.  
Each task is a small program that prints something based on specific rules.

## Files and Tasks

### 0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing
- **File:** `0-positive_or_negative.c`
- Prints whether a random number is positive, negative, or zero.

---

### 1. The last digit
- **File:** `1-last_digit.c`
- Prints the last digit of a random number and describes it (greater than 5, 0, or less than 6 and not 0).

---

### 2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game
- **File:** `2-print_alphabet.c`
- Prints the lowercase alphabet using `putchar`.

---

### 3. alphABET
- **File:** `3-print_alphabets.c`
- Prints the lowercase alphabet, then the uppercase alphabet.

---

### 4. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off
- **File:** `4-print_alphabt.c`
- Prints the lowercase alphabet except for the letters `q` and `e`.

---

### 5. Numbers
- **File:** `5-print_numbers.c`
- Prints all single-digit numbers (`0` to `9`) using `printf`.

---

### 6. Numberz
- **File:** `6-print_numberz.c`
- Prints all single-digit numbers using only `putchar`.

---

### 7. Smile in the mirror
- **File:** `7-print_tebahpla.c`
- Prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse (from `z` to `a`).

---

### 8. Hexadecimal
- **File:** `8-print_base16.c`
- Prints all numbers of base 16 (hexadecimal) in lowercase.

---

### 9. Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success
- **File:** `9-print_comb.c`
- Prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers separated by commas and spaces.

---

## Summary
This project helps practice:
- Declaring and using variables.
- Controlling program flow with `if`, `else`, and loops.
- Printing characters and numbers with `putchar` and `printf`.
