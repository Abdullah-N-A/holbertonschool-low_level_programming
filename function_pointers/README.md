# Function Pointers Project

This project introduces the concept of **function pointers** in C programming.  
It shows how to use functions as parameters, how to manipulate arrays with them, and how to build a simple calculator.

## Tasks

### 0. What's my name
Write a function that prints a name using a function pointer.

---

### 1. If you spend too much time thinking about a thing, you'll never get it done
Write a function that executes another function on each element of an array.

---

### 2. To hell with circumstances; I create opportunities
Write a function that searches for an integer in an array using a comparison function.  
It returns the index of the first match or -1 if not found.

---

### 3. A goal is not always meant to be reached, it often serves simply as something to aim at
Write a program that performs simple arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`) using function pointers.  
It validates the input, handles errors, and executes the correct function dynamically.
