# Recursion

This project focuses on solving problems using **recursion** in C.  
You will learn how to call a function from itself to perform repeated operations.

## Files and Tasks

### 0. Print string recursively
- **File:** `0-puts_recursion.c`
- Function that prints a string using recursion, followed by a new line.

---

### 1. Print string in reverse recursively
- **File:** `1-print_rev_recursion.c`
- Function that prints a string in reverse using recursion.

---

### 2. String length recursively
- **File:** `2-strlen_recursion.c`
- Function that returns the length of a string using recursion.

---

### 3. Factorial recursively
- **File:** `3-factorial.c`
- Function that returns the factorial of a number using recursion.

---

### 4. Power recursively
- **File:** `4-pow_recursion.c`
- Function that returns the value of `x` raised to the power `y` using recursion.

---

### 5. Square root recursively
- **File:** `5-sqrt_recursion.c`
- Function that returns the natural square root of a number using recursion.

---

### 6. Check prime number recursively
- **File:** `6-is_prime_number.c`
- Function that checks if a number is prime using recursion.
